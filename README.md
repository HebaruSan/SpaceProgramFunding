# Space Program Funding #

A mod for Kerbal Space Program that grants a funding allowance per month based on reputation. The funds can be spent on vessels, science points, building reputation (PR), or even saved for a big mission -- all with various benefits and limitations. Play the game like a real Space Program!

## Inspiration
This mod was greatly inspired and based on the mod MonthlyBudgets. Since that mod's author has announced it will no longer be supported and to add new features (almost a complete rewrite), Space Program Funding mod was created. 

## What does this mod do?
**Space Program Funding is designed for use with Career games. It has no purpose in Science or Sandbox games.**

Space Program Funding mod replaces the normal way of acquiring funds -- through completing contracts. Contracts are still available, but mostly have their fund rewards changed into reputation rewards. Funds are given to the player on a monthly basis according the player's reputation level. The calculation is a simple reputation number multiplied by a coefficient constant. Funding is handled like a government agency in that if your funds on hand are below the calculated amount, it will be topped up. If your funds are above this amount, you will receive no extra funds that month as "you already have enough".
## Why use this mod?
The stock game plays out like a private commercial space program. This mod allows it to play out like a government agency. Think of it like Kerbal Aeronautics and Space Administration (KASA). You never really run out of money, but you also never have too much either. Saving for a big project is part of your strategic planning, but also you are encouraged to try experimental missions on a whim since there is a "use it or lose it" mentality with funds as the month end approaches. Funding stays a relevant part of gameplay even through the end-game. As a bonus, there is less need to run boring passenger contracts just to fund the more fun missions.
## How to install this mod?
Copy the `SpaceProgramFunding` folder into the `GameData` folder. An icon will appear in the button bar. Clicking this button brings up the mod's in-game control dialog, but the default behavior should be just fine for the early game. You will notice a chunk of cash deposited into your account every 30 days. Enjoy.
## How do I use this mod?
Play the career game normally. As your reputation rises, so will your bank account at the end of each month. Check out the detailed instructions on what all the basic controls mean, how they function, and why you would change these to suit your changing goals.
## What do all the optional settings mean?
The optional settings can be edited through a secondary in-game pop-up or edited in the configuration file(s) directly. They have a bewildering amount of powerful control. Before altering these, make sure you have a good understanding of what the effect will be. See the documentation for these settings.
